# Swishhyys Custom Items (SCI)

## What is this?
This is a plugin to add cool custom items to SCP: SL using the Exiled Framework. This is mainly produced out of a need to grant more items to the server I host, NNR. To allow my community to have a bit more fun with the game, however, it's also being used as a learning tool for me to make Exiled plugins. I'm hoping the work I'll put into this project will pay off, but we will never know!

### Permissions
```
sci.admin  // Admin perms within the plugin
```
### Commands
```
Grant Command: sci give {playerid} {itemid}
```
### Item List (with ids)
```
Adrenaline SCP 500 (id = 101) // works similar to stims, but effect is more potent; however will damage the user
Expired SCP 500 (id = 102) //grants random effect upon use
```

## I want to see what this plugin does before I add it
I host my server that will feature this plugin amongst other future projects I may work on to further enhance the game.

### Contributions
Check out my [License](https://github.com/Swishhyy/SCI/blob/main/LICENSE.txt), but primarily, I won't focus on suggestions, as this plugin is developed mainly for my server, NNR. Sometimes, I may take suggestions.
You are welcome to fork, but please properly credit me, and I will accept merges as well.

### How to read my updates and what you should do
1.0.0 [Sematic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

The first digit is the major version; if this changes, it means the previous config or code is hugely changed. In short, delete everything and reinstall
The second digit is a minor version. In most cases, your existing configuration will be fine; just update the DLL
The Third digit is a patch version, which means very minor code patches so not any significant changes. This could be fixing a bug or updating the version so it displays properly in the server console.

### WARNING: 
This is my first Exiled plugin, so there may be issues I'm not entirely sure how to fix/handle as I'm also picking up more advanced C# as well. The best way to reach me regarding issues with this plugin or others will be on discord or the issue tracker.
