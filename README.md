# Swishhyys Ultimate Package (SUP)
(ORIGINALLY KNOWN AS SWISHHYYS CUSTOM ITEMS!!!)


I decided to merge all of my plugins into one to make it easier for me to develop my other two and for the person installing them. But I will grant the option not to use certain modules, as you may like one thing but not others, and that's fine!
This configuration WILL be handled inside the primary config, sub configs will be organized by the plugin in their dedicated folders (SCI, SCR, SCE)
